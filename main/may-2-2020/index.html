                Hello ladies and gentlemen. I am the 3rd person of opposition. Todays motion is: THW legalize euthanasia. I will now rebut the previous speaker. The previous speaker said that ________ was _____. However, I think that is not true for the sake of our lives because _____. I will now move on to my first argument. My argument is that we should not legalize euthanasia because if we just throw our life out of the window, our life is over. Life is just a one-time thing and you cannot bring back a dead person to life.  We still don’t know if there is an after-life like haven and hell. If there is, you will regret committing euthanasia because you cannot go back to your original life. If there isn’t an after-life, you won’t feel a thing, you will just be in complete darkness like when you sleep. It will be a complete waste if you commit euthanasia just because you are suffering a lot. Alive is alive. But many people still commit euthanasia because they are suffering from a serious disease. Everyday, people die from euthanasia without knowing life’s true worth. Medical companies are just using people who commit euthanasia by earning a lot of money from it. One of the reasons why medical companies don’t focus on medicine and other medical-related stuff is because of people who commit euthanasia. It would be much peaceful if people didn’t commit euthanasia. Thank you for listening to my speech.
